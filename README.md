# Magento 1.9 Bootstrap Project

Demonstrates using [n98 Magenrun](https://github.com/netz98/n98-magerun) to disconnect projects source code from Magento install. Allows for development of a Magento site without adding Magento's own files to a repo.

This is accomplished via symlinks and the `install.sh` file.

Also demonstrates how to programatically add Magento configuration at runtime, custom CMS attributes, RestAPI configuration, and site Templates/Pages to the CMS automatically, removing some of the boilerplate CMS setup when a new developer starts on the project or a site needs to be rebuilt.
